This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error message indicating that the Android SDK is not found or is improperly configured. This can happen even if the Android SDK is correctly installed and configured in the system's environment variables. The error may be vague and not point to the exact root cause, making it difficult to diagnose.

Example Error Message:

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
...
...
Some error message regarding Android SDK not being found
...
```
